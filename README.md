# mac-changer
A simple python script to change your mac changer in Linux Based Systems.
##Usage
```bash
python mac_changer.py [--interface interface] [--mac_addr mac_addr]

It comes with random mac address generator so mac_addr field is optional. Also, the script employs new F-strings to cocatenate variables and strings very efficiently so you may need to update python.
